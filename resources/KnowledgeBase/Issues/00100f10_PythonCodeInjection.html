<h1>Issue description</h1>

<p>Server-side code injection vulnerabilities arise when an application 
  incorporates user-controllable data into a string that is dynamically evaluated by 
  a code interpreter. If the user data is not strictly validated, an attacker 
  can use crafted input to modify the code to be executed, and inject 
  arbitrary code that will be executed by the server.</p>
<p>Server-side code injection vulnerabilities are usually very serious and lead to 
  complete compromise of the application's 
  data and functionality, and often of the server that is hosting the application.
  It may also be possible to use the server as a platform for further attacks against other systems.</p>

<h1>Issue remediation</h1>

<p>Whenever possible, applications should avoid incorporating user-controllable data into 
  dynamically evaluated code. In almost every situation, there are safer alternative 
  methods of implementing application functions, which cannot be 
  manipulated to inject arbitrary code into the server's processing.</p>
<p>If it is considered unavoidable to incorporate user-supplied data into 
  dynamically evaluated code, then the data should be strictly validated. Ideally, a whitelist of specific accepted 
  values should be used. Otherwise, only short alphanumeric strings should be accepted. 
  Input containing any other data, including any conceivable code metacharacters, should be rejected. </p>
